# VBA-Challenge
This project involves a VBA script I developed to analyze stock data from the "alphabetical_testing.xlsx" sheet, a smaller dataset for faster testing. The script loops through a quarter of stock data, extracting values such as ticker symbol, stock volume, open price, and close price. It then creates new columns for ticker symbol, total stock volume, quarterly change ($), and percent change. Conditional formatting is applied to both the quarterly change and percent change columns. The script also calculates and displays the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume, and works consistently across all sheets for a smooth user experience.
